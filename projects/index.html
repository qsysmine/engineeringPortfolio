                <i>January to March 2017</i>
                <p>In late January 2017, my Introduction to Engineering and Design class was instructed to use Autodesk Inventor to model and assemble a toy train engine that could drive on a straight and curved track. After doing so, the class was assigned groups to create a custom toy train with an innovative and colourful design. My group decided to work with the concept of cars, creating a Honda Accord, a Jeep Wrangler, a Mini Cooper, and a Ford F-100 truck in Inventor. I created the truck and assembled the whole selection, allowing it to drive effectively through clever solutions and hard work. While I was not the project manager, I worked closely with ours to make sure our project had as good a result as possible.</p>
                <p>The project was intended to let us loose in Inventor, improve our presentation skills, and check whether we could work together properly. My team was able to overcome its differences and succeed in creating an innovative and fun train set.</div>

                <i>May 2017</i>
                <p>In mid-May 2017, all of the classes in the engineering academy, including my Introduction to Engineering and Design class, were instructed to form groups and create a product. I placed myself with Nile Desta, Aditi Jagannathan, and James Sevilla, other members of our school's Cross Country and track teams. After brainstorming products that would be relevant to our teams, we ended up choosing a concept for a foam roller which heats and cools itself using electricity; prior products were heatable and coolable using microwaves and freezers, but none could change their own temperature. My team created Autodesk Inventor files, a presentation, and a website for our roller at <a href="https://ari-s.com/entrepreneurshipProject">us.to/rollteq</a>.

                <i>31 October to 16 November, 2017</i>
                <p>The objective of the project was to find the best power source for the client, Tesla Motors, to use in their cars. We did this using VEX parts to model the motors and the wheels of the car.</p>
                <p>My responsibilities were to complete much of the documentation along with the Gantt Chart. I ended up spending a lot of my time refilling hydrogen cells and wiring banana plugs.
                </p>
                <p>I learned that there should always be extra room included in a schedule in case something unexpected, such as the bomb threat that forced DHS to be evacuated, happens and throws you off course.
                </p>
                <p>This project exemplified my adaptivity, as when a teammate changed the design without warning or consultation, I helped test the new system.

                <i>9 March to 21 March, 2018</i>
                <p>The objective of this project was to learn about bridge design and all the different factors that go along with it. We designed a bridge for the American Bridge Company so there was a way to cross the Trinity River and designed a simple truss bridge that delivered the maximum stability for its cost.</p>
                <p>My responsibilities were to help brainstorm bridges along with modifying the final design in order to maximise its positive attributes. I spent a lot of my time tweaking individual beams in order to make the bridge more stable as well as writing the documentation. I also maintained the Gantt Chart.</p>
                <p>In this project, I learned that sometimes you have to put in extra work to make up for your teammates' time constraints in doing their part.</p>
                <p>This project exemplified my thinking-on-my-feet because I was made to mostly ad-lib a presentation to overwhelmingly positive reception by my class.</p>
