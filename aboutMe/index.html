                When I was in fourth grade, I started to learn how to make websites. Ever since then, app development has been my passion. Engineering of any kind, especially software engineering, is a unique way to have fun while working and make a good living at the same time. To pursue engineering, the easiest path for me to follow would be to study Software Engineering or Mechanical Engineering in college and to find a job in one of those two fields.

                Starting with basic web development, the logical progression for me was to learn web technologies. I built a number of basic web pages, exploring the different features of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. As I wanted to expand my skills, I built a very basic blog system in PHP and MySQL. At the same time, I began to attend Wells Middle School, at which I would be awarded the Pricipal's Honor Roll every quarter I attended. Later, I built <a href="https://github.com/QuartzSystems/aC.qzqp.tk">an informational website about countries</a> in NodeJS and Express as a way for me to branch off into server-side programming.

                More recently, I have been able to diversify my skills even more. When Firebase was introduced, I used it to create a <a href="https://github.com/QuartzSystems/keepthestorygoing.tk">very simple game</a>. After middle school ended, I joined Dublin Cross Country and have run three seasons with the Cross Country and Distance Track teams, as well as creating <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dublin-distance/id1228191776">an app</a> to manage some of the exercises we do after running. When I began attending Dublin High School, I joined the club for the newspaper, The Dublin Shield, at which I have been both a Layout Officer and the Cover Designer for six issues straight. I also learned some simple parts the Swift programming language and, eventually, used it to create <a href="http://tinyurl.com/dhsBell">an app</a> that made it all the way to the iOS App Store.

                While I have learned some technology and life skills, I know that I still have much more to learn. Thank you for taking the time to read about me, and please use the navigation at the top to explore what I am about.
