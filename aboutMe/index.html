                Ever since fifth grade, making apps has been my passion. Engineering of any kind, especially software engineering, is my way to have fun while working at the same time as making a good living. To pursue engineering, the most natural path for me to follow would be to take the Computer Science pathway in the Dublin Engineering and Design Academy and go on to study Software Engineering in college and to find a job in one of those two fields.

                My progression in development began with basic web development. I built a number of basic web pages and went through a phase where I tried to make websites out of XSLT rules and XML. Over time, I explored several different features of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. As I wanted to expand my skills, I built an experimental blog system in PHP and MySQL. Later, I learned other web technologies by building a series of informational websites with open web APIs.</p>

                More recently, I have been able to diversify my skills even more. When I began attending Dublin High School, I joined the Dublin Cross Country and Distance teams. I also created <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dublin-distance/id1228191776">the Dublin Distance App</a> to manage some of the exercises we do after we run our practice. At the same time, I also started as a Layout officer at The Dublin Shield. After two years of being an officer, the editor-in-chief promoted me to Layout Editor in May 2018. I also learned basic use of the Swift programming language and, eventually, used it to create <a href="http://tinyurl.com/dhsBell">The DHS Bell Schedule App</a>, which became a semi-passive source of income as well as a way to learn new things about iOS apps and app development.

                While I have learned some technology and life skills, I know that I still have much more to learn. Thank you for taking the time to read about me, and please use the navigation at the top to explore what I am about.
