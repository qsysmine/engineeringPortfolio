                <i>8 Mar. 2018</i>
                <p>In March 2018, Google invited the Dublin Engineering and Design Academy on a field trip to their headquarters. Google showed the attendants, including myself, their new product, Bulletin, and walked us through the process of designing a product and going from concept to reality. We were shown the Google campus and met several members of the Bulletin team from a set of diverse educational and cultural backgrounds.</p>
                <p>Afterwards, we went to the Santa Clara University and were shown the engineering program at a Jesuit college. The trip made me appreciate the amenities DEDA has at its disposal and showed me how engineering programs are at the university level.</p>

                <i>26 Feb. 2018</i>
                <p>In late February of 2018, two guest speakers in the Civil Engineering discipline presented about education, jobs, and life within their section of engineering. The key takeaways were how difficult it was to graduate college as a civil engineer, how much work is often needed to move up within an engineering firm, and the several differences between small and large civil engineering firms.</p>
