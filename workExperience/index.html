                    The Dublin Engineering and Design Academy has provided me great opportunities to learn about the fields of engineering and the engineering process. Since I don't have a real job, I have recounted my experiences on a field trip provided by the Academy and a set of guest speakers to my engineering class.

                <i>8 March 2018</i>
                <p>
                    In March 2018, Google invited the Dublin Engineering and Design Academy on a field trip to their headquarters. Google showed the attendants, including myself, their new product, Bulletin, and walked us through the process of designing a product and going from concept to reality. Guides from the company showed us the Google campus and met several members of the Bulletin team from a set of diverse educational and cultural backgrounds. I learned that even going to a liberal-arts focused college, such as Harvey Mudd, does not disqualify you from having what many engineers consider a dream job, namely working for Google in an engineering capacity. The Bulletin presentation taught me that even companies as gargantuan as Google follow the same engineering process as Dublin Engineering and Design Academy classes have taught us.

                    Afterward, we went to the Santa Clara University where students showed us the engineering program at the Jesuit college. The trip revealed to me how engineering programs function at the university level. This was particularly obvious at Santa Clara. The university, despite its relatively small size, had a rather small engineering program. It was thrilling to see a university in such proximity to Dublin.

                <i>26 February 2018</i>
                <p>
                    In late February of 2018, two guest speakers in the Civil Engineering discipline presented about education, jobs, and life within their section of engineering. The key takeaways were how difficult it was to graduate college as a civil engineer, how much work is often needed to move up within an engineering firm, and the several differences between small and large civil engineering firms. I learned that civil engineering is a good way to be the change in the world.

                <p>
                    I was interested in these guest speakers because, as a fellow human and user of infrastructure, I felt that civil engineers could use their field as a tool to expand accessibility to buildings and places. As a bicyclist, especially one who commutes to school daily, I thought that civil engineering could be an avenue to expand the availability of bike lanes and other shared-use roads to more places. The purpose of the guest speakers was to augment the knowledge of the students about the field of civil engineering.
